## Medical-Papers-Skimming

Finshed on 14/10/2022

Also Known as SkimLit or PubMed.

In this notebook, I replicated a [**state-of-the-art (NLP) model**](https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.06071) to breakdown research abstracts into smaller, more understandable pieces to help researchers skim through literatures.

## Disaster Tweets
Given Tweets, the model(s) shall detect emerginces/disasters and predicts which Tweets are about real disasters and which one’s aren’t.

In this notebook, we are going to bulid:

0. A traditional Machine Learning Model.
1. Simple Deep Learning Model.
2. Deep Learning model using Transfer learning.

**Data Source**:
