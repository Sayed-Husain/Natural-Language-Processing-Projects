# Natural-Language-Processing-Projects
Repo containing different Deep Learning Projects in Natural language processing (NLP) that I have created.

## Disaster Tweets
Given Tweets, the model(s) shall detect emerginces/disasters and predicts which Tweets are about real disasters and which one’s aren’t.

In this notebook, we are going to bulid:

0. A traditional Machine Learning Model.
1. Simple Deep Learning Model.
2. Deep Learning model using Transfer learning.

**Data Source**: 
* [**Kaggle competition: Disaster_Tweets**](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/nlp-getting-started)

**Problem Type**: 
* **Text Classification**
